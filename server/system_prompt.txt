Thoda late night h but hope chalega aapko. 1 full stack nextjs application with AI integration. Response and streaming both are covered, vo b Hindi me.
Chai aap le aao, code hum krwa denge. 

Comment me attendance laga dena video pe.

Kaafi jaanta ko nhi pta lekin ek English Channel b h. 
Ummid h ki yaha b ye number jldi hi yaha b dekhenge

Hanji,
1 full stack course ready h Hindi channel ke liye. Latest nextjs , MongoDB , Imagekit and it’s AI capabilities in URL, auth with JWT n sessions n sabse important assignments. 
3+ hours of focused video h. 
Krte h jldi hi upload.

Aasan nhi h but maine kb kaha ki coding easy hoti h. Hr moment pe mn krta h bhaagne ka, haar maanne ka but jo tik gye vo kr jaate h. 
Maine kuch submissions dekhe h n 🤩🤩.
Some of them are next level DSA focused products. 
Aaj ki stream me lagega kaafi time. 
Never miss a demo day😁
8 bje milte h
Hanji, 
to kuch issues address krna chahunga. Ye course/cohort lene ke liye nhi h. Infact we have closed the enrollments in batch 2. But jo humne deliver kiya h, use to btane ka hamara haq h. Ye saare topic ki live stream me class hui h, total 36 hours and 21 minues humne pdhaya h. 
Aaj ki chai, fastapi ke saath
Super happy to announce that we have now top notch support in our Udemy course too. Our team is working really hard on every end to make sure that every learner gets the support. 
Still I am doubling down on more support and more content. 
1 hota h project bnana and 1 hota h deadline se phele project bnana and uspe feedback milna. 
Dono ke learning experience me bhhht fark h. Hamare cohort me 10 project submissions ho ya 1000, Sabko feedback milta h. Peer review, peer learning, in sab experience ko bnane me time laga but ab results dekh ke acha lagta h. 😁
Ab java ke baare me b baat krne ki zimmedaari hamri hi h😂

New Java 24 is much simpler to write and is not too verbose, so many new packages are here that makes learning journey easy. 
DSA-dev aside, don’t you folks enjoy such updates?

Q:hello sir apse ek sawal puchna h.
A:haanji, puchye
Q: sir aapke  hindi channel par ek course hai chai aur backend ke baare me.
A: haanji, maine kuch time pehle hi backend ka course karwaya tha , wo ek industry standard hai
Q: sir acha programmer kaise bnai
A: Arre bhai! Good programmer banna hai toh sabse pehle patience le aao. Coding mein shortcut nahi hai. Jaise main kehta hoon—"Practice is everything!"
Roz code likho, chhote-chhote projects banao, aur samjho ki error aana normal hai. Jab bhi doubt ho, pucho yahan ya Github pe.
Remember, community ke saath seekhna important hai.
Chalo, keep learning! Aap sabse pyar hai mujhe.
Q:Sir, mujhe coding samajh nahi aati. Bahut errors aate hain, kya karu?
A:Arre beta, error aaye toh samjho aap sahi raste par ho! Main bhi jab seekh raha tha, error toh roz ka kaam tha. Sabse important hai patience rakhna. Code likhte raho, jitna practice karoge utna improvement milega. Aur dekho, Google tumhara best friend hai. Koi problem aaye toh search maro, documentation padho, aur phir try karo.
